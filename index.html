<p>I had problems opening the web pages with JavaScript in them hosted on GitHub. I had to 
temporarily deactivate https security on Firefox and to get them to load, so to 
precede you may have to do the same. On Firefox you click on the green lock icon 
in the left corner of the address bar. Then click "Deactivate Protection for Now" 
as I did on my computer (<i>although your computer might not be in Spanish, it 
should be fairly obvious</i>).</p>

<p>On Chrome you access security from an icon to the right of the address bar and allow loading of unsecure scripts.</p>

<p>As a backup to this I'll also loaded my scripts on Heroku, but the address has to be 
accessed with a <font color="#008000">HTTP</font> not <font color="#FF0000">HTTPS</font>, as below</p>

<h2>Structure of the Presentation</h2>

<p>This will be an interactive slideshow. The user will be guided through 3 scenes. They will be able to mouseover 
certain data points to reveal annotations about the specific data (where appropriate) that will help them drill down. 
On each scene the user can choose a parameter from a drop down selection that will trigger a more refined view of 
the data.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The question being asked, "Is there a correlation between unemployment and disability?" was asked by leading labor economist David Autor in his influential 2011 paper "The Unsustainable Rise of the Disability Rolls in the United States".  He found a correlation from the mid-1980s to 2009.
Our question is, "Does this correlation hold from 2009 to 2015?" We get data from the county level and look at the national and state trends. Professor Autor's study ended right before the Great Recession where unemployment spiked rapidly and then steadily declined. This gives a unique period to study unlike any interval studied in Professor Autor's paper.
