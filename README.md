The last few years I've been focused on Data Science and Analytics, so that's what you'll see on this page.  
  
I've put up a few of my projects that I did while I was working on my Master's in Data Science and from on line courses. In 2015 I wrote Data Science blog posts for BBVA Data & Analytics, and there are links to that work.
